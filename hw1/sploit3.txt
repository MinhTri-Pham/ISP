The program has input of the form [count],[data]
Copies [count] * sizeof(struct widget_t) into buf, tries to implement a check for count
Problem is that it first casts count from unsigned to signed and then back to unsigned when copying
When changing unsigned to signed, count can become negative and so pass the check
Then when it's changed back to unsigned, so we can copy a big chunk of data and overflow the buffer
Hence we can perform similar attack to sploit1
